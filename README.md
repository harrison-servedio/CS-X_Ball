# GCDS CS-X Ball Class
## Description
This repo is to be used in the GCDS CS-X class. It contains a framework ball class designed to help students starting out with object-oriented programming. This ball could represent a projectile, planet, particle, or anything similar. 
This repo contains demonstrations on graphing with Matplotlib in Python. 
## Usage
In order to use this class, download the `ballClass.py` file and put it into your project directory. From here the class can be imported into other files for use in your projects. This file can be modified to suit the needs of your project. 
## Demo
### `singleBallStill.py`
An example of graphing the path of a single ball instance using Matplotlib where the movements of the ball are generated before graphing with the `step` method of the ball class
### `singleBallAnimate.py`
An example of animating a single ball instance using Matplotlib where the movements of the ball are generated during the animation with the `step` method of the ball class
### `multiBallAnimate.py`
An example of animating multiple ball instances with Matplotlib where the movements of the balls are generated during the animation with the `step` method of the ball class
